# Nacre

Nacre is a Ruby gem that wraps the API of the Brightpearl accounting software service.

http://www.brightpearl.com/developer/latest/

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "nacre", :git => "git://github.com/allolex/nacre.git"
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'nacre'
api = Nacre::Api.new( file: 'config/test_config.yml' )
products_list = Nacre::API::Product.all
product = Nacre::API::Product.find(1000)
```

Make sure you copy the sample config file to `test_config.yml` with your credentials.

## Features

- Configuration support. See config/ for a sample YAML file.
- API authentication

These are functional, but definitely need some work:

- Order

  - Contact
